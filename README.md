# hello-world
This is my first repository on GitHub
I am NOT using branching feature //Added 'NOT' as making updates directly to main branch//
Then I'll commit the changes


*********Start****************
//The below changes are made on 18-Sep-2022 via Mac terminal//
I downloaded the repo on my mac via git bash
Then I created a new branch 'dev'
Then I opened this file on terminal
Then I made these edits
********Thanks****************
